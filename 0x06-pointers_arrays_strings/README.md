**Description**
This repository contains solutions to the "0x06. C - More pointers, arrays, and strings" project, 
which is part of the low-level programming curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program.

The project consists of a series of C functions that perform various operations on strings, pointers, and arrays.

***
**Project Requirements**

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
5. Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. Not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
9. Allowed to use _putchar
10. The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in the header file called main.h
11. Don’t forget to push the header file
