**Doubly Linked Lists**
***
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation and usage of Doubly Linked Lists. The Doubly Linked List is a type of data structure in which each node contains a data element, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.

**List of Files**

The project consists of the following files:

**0-print_dlistint.c**: A C program that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.

**1-dlistint_len.c**: A C program that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.

**2-add_dnodeint.c**: A C program that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

**3-add_dnodeint_end.c**: A C program that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.

**4-free_dlistint.c**: A C program that frees a doubly linked list.

**5-get_dnodeint.c**: A C program that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.

**6-sum_dlistint.c**: A C program that returns the sum of all the elements in a doubly linked list.

**lists.h**: The header file containing function prototypes and struct definition for doubly linked lists.

**Requirements**

1. The programs are written in C and compiled using gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

2. The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, printf, and exit.

3. The code follows the Betty style, which is checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

4. No more than 5 functions are allowed per file.

5. Global variables are not used.

6. The prototypes of all functions are included in the lis
