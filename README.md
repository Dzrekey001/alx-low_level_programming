**Getting Started**
To get started with C programming, you will need to set up your development environment. 
This involves installing a C compiler and a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your computer.
Some popular C compilers include GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++. 
As for text editors, this course required using emacs or vim/vi.


Once you have installed the necessary tools, you can start writing C code in a new file with the .c extension. 
The first program you write in C should be the "Hello, World!" program, which simply outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
