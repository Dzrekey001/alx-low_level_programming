**C Pointer Task**
***
This is a task that involves using pointers in C to manipulate memory and data structures. 
The goal of the task is to write a program that performs the following tasks:

Allocate memory for an array of integers using malloc.

Fill the array with random numbers.

Print the array.

Swap two elements in the array using pointers.

Sort the array using a bubble sort algorithm.

Print the sorted array.

***

**Usage**
To run the program, compile the main.c file using a C compiler of your choice, such as gcc:


Copy code

gcc main.c -o program

Then, run the compiled program:

./program


The program will then allocate memory for an array of integers, fill it with random numbers, print the array, 
swap two elements using pointers, sort the array using a bubble sort algorithm, and finally print the sorted array.

***
*Notes*

This task is meant to demonstrate the use of pointers in C and to provide practice with memory management and data structures.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive or optimized solution. There are many ways to improve the program's efficiency or functionality, 
such as using a more efficient sorting algorithm or implementing error handling.
