**Introduction to Variables, If-Else, and While in C Programming**

C is a powerful programming language that is widely used in computer science and software development. 
In this readme, we will discuss the basics of variables, if-else statements, and while loops in C programming.

**Variables**
A variable is a named storage location in memory that can hold a value of a specific data type. In C programming, you must declare a variable before using it.

**An if-else** statement is used to make a decision in a program. 
It allows the program to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. 

**While Loops**
A while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly while a certain condition is true.

**Conclusion**
In this readme, we covered the basics of variables, if-else statements, and while loops in C programming. Understanding the  fundamental concepts is the best way to start learning a programming language. 
Understanding these concepts will help you write effective and efficient code in your C programs.
